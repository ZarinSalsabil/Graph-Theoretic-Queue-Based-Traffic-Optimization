# Graph-Theoretic-Queue-Based-Traffic-Optimization
Dhaka’s traffic crisis drains time, fuel, and air quality. Instead of costly roads, we apply math and computation—graph theory, queueing models, and optimization (faster service rates, smart rerouting) with OSM-based simulations. Results show 20–30% less congestion, proving intelligence—not concrete—can engineer sustainable mobility.
